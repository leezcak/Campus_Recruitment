### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the recruitment landscape of an university. By analysing various aspects of the recruitment profile, we seek to identify trends, seek data-driven recommendations, and gain a deper understanding of the student body.

### Data Sources
- Campus Recruitment Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "campus_recruitment.csv" file, containing detailed information about placement data of an anonymous university students. The Kaggle dataset is downloadable [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement).

### Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

   
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the distribution of gender among different degrees?
- What are the most common educational backgrounds among the students?
- What is the distribution of placement status (Placed vs. Not Placed)?
- What is the salary distribution among placed students and what factors affect the distribution?
- How does prior work experience affect placement status and salary?
