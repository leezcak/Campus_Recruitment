### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the recruitment landscape of an university. By analysing various aspects of the recruitment profile, we seek to identify trends, seek data-driven recommendations, and gain a deper understanding of the student body.

### Data Sources
- Campus Recruitment Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "campus_recruitment.csv" file, containing detailed information about placement data of an anonymous university students. The Kaggle dataset is downloadable [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement).

### Tools
- Excel: Data Cleaning & Formatting
- Tableau: Data Visualisation [[final dashboard]](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ireneyejinlee/viz/MBACampusRecruitmentDashboard/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

### Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling duplicates and missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the distribution of gender among different degrees?
- Do secondary education affect MBA placement and starting salary?
- What is the distribution of placement status (Placed vs. Not Placed)?
- Is there correlation between MBA entrance exam grade and MBA grade?
- Is there correlation between starting salary and MBA grade?
- What is the median salary among placed students?
- How does work experience, placement status, and salary affect one another?

### Data Analysis
These are the column headers of "campus_recruitment.csv" that we renamed for better legibility.

Some variables defied my initial expectations. For example, there was no clear correlation between MBA entrance exam grade and MBA course grade, with a R^2 of 0.005 and p-val of 0.001.

The final dashboard is attached below.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

### Limitations
The currency was not specified, but since this dataset is from an university in Bangalore, India, we assumed that the starting salary was in Indian Rupees. According to Indeed, the average MBA starting salary is approximately ₹357,820 per year. Our median salary ₹265,000
